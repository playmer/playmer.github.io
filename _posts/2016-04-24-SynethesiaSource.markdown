Team Salt completed Synethesia's Beta during April of 2016.

Someone was curious to look at the source of Synethesia, so I'm uploading a zip of it until I can convince DigiPen to allow me to BSD license it. Everything that isn't explicitly marked (and some specific things listed in the ReadMe just in case) is owned by DigiPen. This includes the Editor (which is built separately from the game), as it's dynamically linked to Qt and thus shouldn't require a GPL license for it to my understanding.
