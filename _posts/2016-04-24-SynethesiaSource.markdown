Team Salt completed Synethesia's Beta during April of 2016.

Someone was curious to look at the source of Synethesia, so I'm uploading a zip of it until I can convince DigiPen to allow me to BSD license it. Everything that isn't explicitly marked (and some specific things listed in the ReadMe just in case) is owned by DigiPen. This includes the Editor (which is built separately from the game), as it's dynamically linked to Qt and thus shouldn't require a GPL license for it to my understanding.


~The source can be downloaded here.~ (No it can't, I temporarily am taking it down until I have time to remove some heavy stuff I forgot to when I first put this up. Admittedly this will make it no longer have some features, but we do what we have to. Please contact me if you want to see it in the interim: j.fisher@digipen.edu)
