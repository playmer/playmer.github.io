I'm currently a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology and working on a neat little game with a working title of Pixie Skate with Team Salt. I'm really into the build process of C and C++ and want to learn more about it. I'm also interested interested in memory management and related topics.

#Projects:

##Pixie Skate:
Team Skate is working on Pixie Skate. We're still working on prototyping and moving those prototypes into our engine so there aren't any videos yet. The general idea is to capture some

My responsibilities on the project were as such:

- Maintaining and extending our build system.  

- Maintaining the core engine.

- Creating and maintaining WWise integration.

- Maintaining the component/composition system.

- Creating and maintaining the input systems.

- Binding our engine to Zilch, a scripting language we use for some game play code.  

- Utilitizing the reflection system provided by Zilch to automatically serialize/deserialize both our Zilch and C++ components.

Tools and Languages used in these tasks:

- C++  

- CMake Script  

- Zilch  

- Python
