I'm currently a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology and working on a neat little game with a working title of Pixie Skate with Team Salt. I'm really into the build process of C and C++ and want to learn more about it. I'm also interested interested in memory management and related topics.

[My resume can be found here.](/assets/files/Resume.pdf)

#Projects:

##[Pixie Skate](/projects/PixieSkate/):
Pixie Skate is game based on skateboarding and the flow of motion. Players control a ball of light that executes combos of "tricks", causing bursts of light and sound.

##[Ripple](/projects/Ripple/):
2D, top-down, singleplayer, water-physics based game in a relaxing but engaging setting.

##[Soular Eclipse](/projects/SoularEclipse/):
Soular Eclipse is a 2D puzzle game where the player controls the sun to cast shadows to aid the traversal of an NPC

##[Title_of\_Game](/projects/TitleOfGame/):
[Title_of\_Game] was the first game I worked on at DigiPen. We were using Zero Engine, which is an engine built by the folks in R&D and can be described as essentially an in-house Unity. We chose to use Python, as Zilch wasn't well documented yet, and none of the upperclassmen had really used it.

##[delayio](https://github.com/playmer/delayio):
delayio sprung out of a friend not being sure how to "create a console effect using print functions for the narrative portions of my text based adventure". After chatting a bit, I found that delaying output in C like how Role-Playing Games do is an interesting little bit of work. 

So after implementing that I decided to implement a function to process strings so that it wouldn't go past some defined line size, and would prevent word splits. (I should probably go back and make sure this is safe.)
