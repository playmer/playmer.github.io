The Adjective Noun completed Ripple during June of 2015, a "Poetic Experience" game.

My responsibilities on the project were as such:

- Maintaining and extending our build system.  

- Creating and maintaining the "core" systems that allow our other programmers to develop derivative systems.  

- Maintaining our Component system.  

- Binding our engine to Zilch, a scripting language we use for some game play code.  

- Creating gameplay components when needed.  

Tools and Languages used in these tasks:

- C++  

- CMake Script  

- Python  

- Zilch
